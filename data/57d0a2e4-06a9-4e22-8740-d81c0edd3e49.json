This group, which purchases\nmore watches per capita than those older, is our primary market segment. Watch purchases are more likely by\nconsumers in the northeast and Midwest. Many purchases are expected to be impulse, requiring strong point-of-\npurchase support. Seventy percent of the market is concentrated with strong competition from Swatch, Fossil,\nGuess?, and Anne Kline. We have extensive experience in the manufacture of innovative, high quality, precision\nplastics and timing devices permitting us to offer the consumer value in a branded fashion watch. Additionally,\nwe have experience distributing products into 75 percent of the outlets for branded fashion watches.\nOBJECTIVES\nThe combination of a unique, cost-effective design allows us to establish a three percent market share in the first\nyear. The Spree watch project will break-even in 1998.\nMARKETING STRATEGIES\nGeneral will introduce a new product, the innovative Spree watch, using penetration pricing, extensive\nadvertising, and expanded distribution in order to increase our revenues and growth rate.\nACTION PLAN\nThe Spree watch has strong product benefits compared to current market offerings. To achieve our objectives we\nwill offer our unique watch in a variety of designs at a suggested retail price of $45. Our current distribution\ncovers 75 percent of the market. At this time we will not expand our distribution to access the jewelry store retail\nchannel. We will increase our sales force by 5 persons and add a sales trainer to support for our market plan.\nAdvertising of one million dollars will emphasis the unique design of the watch and is weighted toward print and\npoint-of-purchase displays. This and television advertising will be scheduled two-thirds in the first six months of\nthe campaign. To achieve consumer awareness in the first year, our advertising voice share will be considerably\nhigher than that of the four market leaders.\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND EXPECTED RESULTS\nWe expect first year sales of 8.5 million dollars and project break-even for the project in the first year.\nCONTINGENCY PLANS\nIf the competition increases advertising or our sales are less than expected, we are prepared to add as much\n$500,000 to our advertising budget.\nSPREE - THE MARKET PLAN\nSITUATION ANALYSIS\nhttps://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbpitt/SpreeMPE.htm 1/7\n--- Page 2 ---\n21/03/2025, 17:18 AN EXAMPLE OF A MARKETING PLAN\nGeneral's core business is industrial timing devices and consumer clocks, based on skills in\nmanufacturing high quality timing movements and plastic casings. This market plan is based on\nproviding consumers with a high quality, innovative watch. It will be offered in a variety of styles for\nboth men and women. The casing and movement has other potential applications not discussed in this\nplan.\nOur 1995 profits of 30 million dollars represent 7.5 percent of total sales. Sales growth has slowed to a\ncurrent level of 5 percent annually. Growth in current markets is expected to be limited. The Spree\nwatch is one of several projects with the potential to improve General's growth rate.\nMarket Analysis\nThe Spree watch will compete directly with several other branded fashion watches. The market size for\nbranded fashion watches is forecast to be $524 million retail dollars in 1998, growing to $721 million\nby 2002. Annual market growth is expected to exceed six percent through 2002, exceeding our current\nannual sales growth.\nMarket Segments\nTable 1: Market Segments by Age\nAGE PERCENT PERCENT OF RELATIVE Those under 35 years of age purchase slightly over 50\nOF WATCH POPULATION PURCHASE\npercent of all branded fashion watches as shown in the\nBUYERS OVER 17 INDEX\nTable 1. The highest purchase prevalence is those from\n18-24 19% 13% 1.46 25 to 34 who purchase 74 percent more watches per\ncapita than those the average consumer. Purchase\n25-34 33 19 1.74\nbehavior is expected to differ among age segments and\n35-54 35 40 0.88 by gender. Young females [18-24 years of age] are\nexpected to be intense purchasers. This group is likely to\n55+ 13 29 0.45\nbe very styling conscious. Women in the 25 to 34 age\ngroup will be our second significant segment, expected to buy more watches than any other age-sex\nsegment.\nConsumer purchases of branded fashion watches also vary by region as shown in Table 2. An index of\nrelative watch sales by regions shows that sales are above average in the east north central, west north\ncentral, north central, and midatlantic states. Product introduction is likely to be more successful in the\nstates in these regions.\nTable 2: Watch Sales by Region\nREGION WATCH SALES POPULATION INDEX OF Consumer Behavior\nWATCH\nSALES\n%\nSwatch has changed watch buying habits by encouraging\nENC 20% 15% 1.33\nownership of multiple low-priced, carefully designed\nSA 16 17 0.94\nbranded fashion watches.

We currently have access to four of these\nchannels, representing 75 percent of watch sales. Channel development is necessary to reach the total\nwatch market. A majority of branded fashion watches are currently purchased at department stores. We\nwill take advantage of our strong distribution through department, discount, and drug stores to assure\nwidespread availability of Spree watches. Jewelry store channel development will be deferred until we\nare established in our traditional retail channels.\nCompetitive Analysis\nAlthough there are fourteen competitors in this market, there is substantial concentration. Swatch,\nFossil, Guess?, and Anne Kline are strong competitors, holding 70 percent of the market. Swatch and\nFossil have strong manufacturing and distribution skills, while Guess? and Anne Kline have less\nextensive distribution networks but strong name recognition in fashion. Fossil and Swatch are strong at\nthe lower price lines. Branded fashion watches are a relatively new product category. Although\npioneered by Swatch, there is considerable opportunity for new entrants as demonstrated by Fossil and\nGuess?.\nCompany Analysis\nGeneral currently distributes products through channels accounting for 75 percent of watch sales.\nBranded fashion watch sales are growing faster than our current product lines. Our innovative product,\nproduct design skills, strong manufacturing skills, and experience in distributing consumer clocks\nprovide an opportunity for entry and growth in this market.\nSWOT Analysis\nStrengths\n\u00b7 Innovative production methods provides the potential for new designs\n\u00b7 Experience in distribution channels for timepieces\nWeaknesses\n\u00b7 No experience in distribution to jewelry stores\n\u00b7 No experience in marketing fashion products\nOpportunities\n\u00b7 Large market\n\u00b7 Market growing faster than our current sales\n\u00b7 Consumer demand for fashion goods creates a demand for innovative products\nThreats\n\u00b7 Strong competition with concentrated market shares\n\u00b7 Possibility of new market entries\nOBJECTIVES\nhttps://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbpitt/SpreeMPE.htm 3/7\n--- Page 4 ---\n21/03/2025, 17:18 AN EXAMPLE OF A MARKETING PLAN\nMarket share of three percent of the branded fashion watch market in the first year [sales of over\n8 million dollars].\nProject break-even in 1998.\nMARKETING STRATEGIES\nGeneral will introduce a new product, the innovative Spree watch, using penetration pricing, extensive\nadvertising, and expanded distribution in order to increase our revenues and growth rate.\nACTION PLAN\nProduct\nWe will introduce between 30 to 40 different designs in the first year. One quarter of these will have a\n\"metal\" case, copying many of the traditional and modern metal designs. These are targeted at\nconsumers 25 and over. We will design a series including licensed characters and unusual shapes for the\nmarket segment under 24 years of age. Swatch does not have exclusive licensing for Disney and Warner\nBrothers characters or Coke. By using these and others we will have a variety of product and character\ndesigns in our line. The most unusual aspect of our line will be some very unusual shapes. Several of\nthese will be geometric; hexagon, trapezoid, oval, and diamond. For younger ages our technology\nallows the design of watches in the shapes of cartoon character faces.\nPrice\nThe Spree watch will be sold for a suggested retail price of $45. We believe that we have product\nquality and feature advantages, encouraging the use of a price slightly exceeding Swatch. This pricing\nstrategy, coupled with our efficient production methods, aids in achieving our relatively high market\nshare for a new product entry.\nDistribution\nWe will introduce Spree in the northeast but within the first year sell to the national market. With our\ncurrent strong distribution channels nationwide covering 75 percent of watch sales, we will limit our\npotential if we restrict our distribution to specific regional markets. Although we do not currently have\njewelry stores, our distribution will place watches in at least 75 percent of locations in the United States.\nWe will use current normal distributor markups.\nPromotion\nFive new sales representatives will be added to assist in the development of new distribution outlets. A\nsales trainer will be hired to train the sales force in the new product. This will be within our $500,000\nsales support budget based on an average salary and benefits cost of $100,000 for each position.\nThe advertising level for the four leading firms can be compared by determining the ratio of voice share\n(% of total advertising dollars of $20 million) divided by the market share as shown in Table 3.\nConsumers will not know our brand; therefore, we will have to advertise more aggressively to achieve\nbrand awareness. Although our market share goal in 1998 is three percent, we will set advertising at one\nmillion dollars. This will achieve an advertising voice/market index considerably higher than our\ncompetition.\nTable 3: Fashion Watch Advertising and Voice\nhttps://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbpitt/SpreeMPE.htm 4/7\n--- Page 5 ---\n21/03/2025, 17:18 AN EXAMPLE OF A MARKETING PLAN\nCOMPANY MARKET VOICE VOICE/ ADVERTISING\nSHARE SHARE\nMARKET MILLION $\nSWATCH 20% 28% 1.4 5.5\nFOSSIL 20% 24% 1.2 4.8\nGUESS? 20% 21% 1.05 4.2\nANNE 13% 13% 1.9 2.5\nKLINE\nSPREE 3% 5% 5.0 1.0\nPLAN [assumes\nsame level\nof total\nadvertising\nas last year]\nMedia will be targeted to our major market segments; women between 18 and 24 and between 25 and\n34. Smaller amounts will be directed to other segments.\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND EXPECTED RESULTS\nAs shown in Tables 1 and 2 of the financial appendix, we expect to achieve a market share of three\npercent and sales of $8.5 million in the first year. The Spree watch project will break-even in the first\nyear. We do not expect any watch technology breakthroughs during this period. Competition is expected\nto be based on design, price, and achieving widespread distribution, areas in which we expect to be very\ncompetitive.\nIn conclusion, we will invest one million dollars in the Spree watch project. We can achieve sufficient\nmarket share to achieve our financial and marketing objectives. During the next five years the market is\nexpected to grow and our costs are expected to decline with experience increasing unit contribution.\nOur greatest challenge will be tracking the market's tastes in watch design and meeting and leading\nthese with creative and innovative designs.\nCONTINGENCY PLANS\nTable 4: Impact of Advertising Levels on Financial Results\nTOTAL AD BUDGET BREAK EVEN NET PRESENT It is not expected that there will be increased price\nYEAR VALUE IN MIL. $\ncompetition due to the entry of the Spree watch. Increased\n$2,500,000 1998 $35.8\n3,000,000 1999 34.0advertising, however, might lead to an increase in industry\n3,500,000 1999 30.4advertising. A sensitivity analysis of the effect of increased\n4,000,000 1999 28.6advertising on our break-even year and cumulative profits\nappears in Table 4. Increases in advertising in steps of an additional $500,000 dollars up to $4 million,\nassuming no additional gains in market share, have fairly limited effect on our performance. Therefore,\nin the event that there is increased industry advertising, we are prepared to increase our advertising by\nas much as $1,500,000 annually. Our increase advertising also will allow us to react to lower than\nexpected consumer awareness, fewer distribution outlets than planned, or less than expected consumer\nacceptance of Spree watch.\nhttps://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbpitt/SpreeMPE.htm 5/7\n--- Page 6 ---\n21/03/2025, 17:18 AN EXAMPLE OF A MARKETING PLAN\nFINANCIAL APPENDIX\nTABLE 1: PRO-FORMA INCOME STATEMENT AT $50
