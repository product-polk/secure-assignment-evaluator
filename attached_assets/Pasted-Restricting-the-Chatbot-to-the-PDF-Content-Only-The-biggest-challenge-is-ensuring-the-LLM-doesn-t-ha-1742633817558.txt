Restricting the Chatbot to the PDF Content Only
The biggest challenge is ensuring the LLM doesn’t hallucinate or produce content from outside the PDF. Some strategies:

Retrieval-Augmented QA with a “Strict” Instruction

Put the LLM in a mode where it is explicitly told: “Answer only using the provided context. If you are not sure, say you do not know.”
Many modern LLMs have “system prompts” or “expert instructions” where you can strictly instruct the model not to use outside knowledge.
Use Smaller Context Windows

If you feed the LLM only the minimal relevant chunk(s) from the document and a strong system message like “Only use the context provided; do not use external data,” you reduce the chance of invented answers.
Restrictive Output Format

You could implement some form of output-checker that disallows code blocks or large paragraphs from being repeated verbatim.
For example, if the LLM tries to produce an exact chunk from the PDF, you can intercept that and transform it or block it.
Pre-QA Summarization

Even before the LLM sees the chunk, you might do a partial summarization on the chunk so that the LLM never sees raw text large enough to reconstruct the assignment in its entirety.
4. Preventing Extraction of the Entire Text or Code
You don’t want the interviewer to simply prompt: “Please give me the entire text or code.” Some ideas:

Excerpt Length Limit

Impose a strict word or character limit on any direct quote from the assignment. The bot might respond:
“Due to content protection, I can only show a short excerpt: ‘...function XYZ calculates the metric…’”

Provide a short snippet or paraphrased explanation.
Chunk-by-Chunk Access

Even if the interviewer tries to ask about every paragraph in sequence, the system can detect that pattern (like if they ask “Give me the next 300 words.” repeatedly).
Then you can throttle the requests or refuse them to prevent reconstruction of the entire text.
Automated Summaries

For code, you can do “explain in words” rather than “dump the entire function.”
For text, you can do “summarize the main points” rather than “copy the entire paragraph.”
